# North-Analog #

By [Ron Ravid](https://github.com/ron064/) & [Gregoire Sage](https://github.com/gregoiresage/)

This is a Watchface for Pebble smartwatch. It was adopted from Pebble SDK example in order to display analog watch as compass. The arrow in the place of 12 o'clock is pointing to north. For most people it is easiest to read the time by rotating the hand/body until the arrow is facing up(north), so maybe it's more fun than it's practical.

### Requirements ###

This watchface requires Pebble SDK 2.5 to complile. It will run on Pebble watch with firmware 2.5
